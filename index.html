<h2> 
    <b><i>🐾🐈  How I adopted Kali ... </i></b>

</h2>
<p> 
  adopted Kali from a close friend’s friend in 2022. I knew I wanted to be responsible and take care of a cat, but I didn’t know I’d end up traveling 5 miles to Brooklyn for her. It was a long day — just me with her on the bus, meowing nonstop and somehow alarming half the passengers.
The amount of care and attention strangers gave her honestly warmed my heart and made the entire journey worth it. Visiting the pet store at the very last minute to make sure she had everything she needed was also a fun experience.
After bringing her home, I slept on pins and needles trying to comfort her and make sure she was adjusting well to her new space. Now, I honestly can’t imagine life without her.
